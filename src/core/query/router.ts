// Question-type router for LongMemEval-style QA.
//
// Replaces the previous regex-inline branching inside buildGraphPrompt with a
// single dispatcher that maps a question (or a caller-provided ground-truth
// category) onto (a) a retrieval strategy used by queryGraph and (b) a
// category-specific prompt block used by buildGraphPrompt.
//
// Six categories from LongMemEval_s:
//   single-session-user        — fact stated by the user in a single session
//   single-session-assistant   — fact stated by the assistant in a single session
//   single-session-preference  — user preference distributed across one session
//   multi-session              — aggregation / synthesis across sessions
//   temporal-reasoning         — time-ordered reasoning, date math, before/after
//   knowledge-update           — superseded fact; answer should be the latest claim
//
// Runtime detection is prioritised. Ground-truth `question_type` is never
// used by default — we publish an honest leaderboard number measured the
// same way as Zep / Mastra.

2. Scan the context and list each instance that matches the question's criterion (e.g., "cuisine" = a national/regional cooking tradition, NOT a diet like "vegan"; "purchase" = an actual buy event, NOT a wish).
3. For each candidate, verify it actually matches — reject loose matches.
4. Distinguish between ADDITIONS and SUPERSEDED totals:
   - If two sessions describe separate events that each add to the total ("I bought 30 lbs" then "I bought 40 lbs"), SUM them.
   - If a later session restates the running total ("I've now collected 25 in total", "my count is up to 12"), USE the most recent stated total — do NOT add it to earlier partial counts.

2. For "how many days/weeks/months ago" questions, subtract the event's date tag from today's date; respect the day-of-week in the tag when the question references a specific weekday.
3. For "the first/last/most recent time I ..." questions, pick the node with the earliest/latest date tag that matches the question's subject.
Do not infer ordering from graph structure — use only the dated evidence. If the relevant dates are missing or tied, say so explicitly.
