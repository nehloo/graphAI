# graphAI — Dual-Graph Knowledge System

**Can AI understand files better than humans can read them?**

graphAI transforms raw files into AI-optimized directed and undirected graph representations. Instead of feeding AI models flat text chunks (the standard RAG approach), graphAI builds a structured knowledge graph with typed relationships — then serializes relevant subgraphs into a format designed for machine comprehension, not human readability.

The result: faster retrieval, richer reasoning, and answers that trace back through explicit relationship chains.

## The Question That Started This

> *"Are AI models based on non-oriented graphs?"*

This question led to an exploration: if AI models internally process information through graph-like structures, could we *externally* represent knowledge the same way? Not as markdown files humans read, but as graph structures AI models traverse?

The insight: **human-readable formats are lossy for AI consumption.** Prose contains redundant phrasing, implicit relationships, linear structure that hides non-linear connections, and ambiguity that humans resolve with world knowledge but AI must guess at. A purpose-built AI-native format could be dramatically more efficient.

## How It Works

### The Pipeline

```
RAW FILES (any format)  ──>  DETERMINISTIC PIPELINE ($0)  ──>  DUAL GRAPH
                                                                   |
CONVERSATIONS  ─────────────────────────────────────>    TEMPORAL + IDENTITY LAYER
                                                                   |
                                                          LLM ENRICHMENT (optional)
                                                                   |
                                                          ENRICHED GRAPH (.gai)
                                                        /      |        \
                                                   QUERY    GIKI       AUDIT
                                                     |    (pages)    (reports)
                                                  ANSWER
                                                     ^
                                             HUMAN CORRECTIONS
```

**Deterministic pipeline ($0):** Parsing, chunking, entity extraction, TF-IDF similarity, graph construction — all pure JS, zero API calls.

**LLM enrichment (optional):** Adds synthesis (one-sentence insight), contextual explanation, and source quality annotation per node. Costs ~$0.50-2 per dataset.

**Human corrections:** Add facts, edit nodes, supersede outdated info, or bulk-import markdown. Human-corrected nodes get maximum confidence (1.0).

**Giki pages:** Human-readable topic pages auto-generated from the graph, with citations back to specific graph nodes.

**Audit reports:** Entity breakdowns, contradiction detection, cross-domain discoveries, health dashboard, markdown export.

### The Dual-Graph Model

Every piece of knowledge exists as a **node**. Nodes are connected by two types of edges:

**Directed edges** (arrows — A -> B) represent:
- `contains` — a section contains a paragraph
- `precedes` — one fact follows another in sequence
- `cites` — one source references another
- `defines` — a definition explains a concept used elsewhere
- `causes`, `supports`, `contradicts` — causal and logical relationships
- `supersedes` — new information replaces old (with provenance)
- `discussed-in` — knowledge traced back to conversation origin
- `knows`, `works-with`, `reports-to` — person relationships

**Undirected edges** (lines — A <-> B) represent:
- `similar-to` — two facts share vocabulary (measured by TF-IDF cosine similarity)
- `shares-entity` — two facts mention the same person, place, or concept
- `co-occurs` — two facts appear in the same section
- `same-person` — two mentions of the same person across sources
- `related-to` — general association between people or concepts

Both edge types exist over the **same node set**. This dual structure gives AI models richer reasoning paths than either graph type alone.

### Temporal Awareness

Every node tracks:
- `createdAt` — when the knowledge was first ingested
- `lastAccessedAt` — when it was last retrieved in a query
- `accessCount` — how many times it's been used
- `validUntil` — optional expiration (for superseded information)
- `confidence` — 0-1 score that decays over time if knowledge isn't reinforced

The query engine applies temporal scoring: recently accessed nodes score higher, frequently used nodes score higher, expired nodes score 0.3x. Knowledge that isn't accessed for 7+ days begins to decay.

### Conversation Memory

graphAI ingests conversations (Claude, ChatGPT, Slack, raw text) into the same graph as domain knowledge. Each conversation turn becomes a node with `discussed-in` edges linking to the knowledge it references. This means the system remembers *what you discussed* alongside *what it knows*.

### Identity Layer

Person entities mentioned 2+ times across sources automatically get dedicated person nodes with:
- Inferred attributes (role, organization) from surrounding content
- Relationship edges between co-mentioned persons
- User profile inference from conversation patterns

### The .gai Format

Instead of storing knowledge as human-readable markdown, graphAI uses a binary format (`.gai`) built on MessagePack:

```
[4-byte magic: "GAI" + version]
[4-byte header length]
[MessagePack header: node count, edge count, levels, metadata]
[MessagePack body: nodes, directed edges, undirected edges, hierarchy]
[4-byte checksum]
```

This isn't designed for humans to read. It's designed for AI to consume efficiently — fewer tokens, explicit structure, typed relationships.

### How Queries Work

When you ask a question:

1. **Query decomposition** — Complex questions are split into sub-queries; each is expanded with synonyms derived from the graph itself
2. **Seed finding** — TF-IDF matching across all query variants identifies the most relevant nodes
3. **Graph traversal** — BFS from seed nodes with temporal scoring (recency + frequency + confidence)
4. **Subgraph extraction** — Top 20 nodes + connecting edges, including enriched synthesis when available
5. **Serialization** — Structured format with explicit edges for LLM reasoning:

```
=== KNOWLEDGE SUBGRAPH (20 nodes, 58 edges) ===

--- NODES ---
[n1|event|0.53] The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing...
[n2|fact|0.38] A universal Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine...

--- DIRECTED ---
n1 -[defines:0.9]-> n2

--- UNDIRECTED ---
n1 ~[similar-to:0.7]~ n2

--- ENRICHED INSIGHTS ---
[event|0.53] SYNTHESIS: Turing's 1936 paper laid the theoretical foundation for all computation
  CONTEXT: This event preceded physical computers by a decade and connects to Church's lambda calculus
```

## Prior Art & What's Different

Graph-based RAG is an active research area. Microsoft's **GraphRAG** (2025) pioneered community detection and hierarchical summaries on knowledge graphs. **LightRAG** (EMNLP 2025) introduced dual-level retrieval combining entity extraction with abstract reasoning. **LazyGraphRAG** achieved 700x query cost reduction vs GraphRAG.

graphAI's contribution is a specific combination that hasn't been published as a unified system:

- **Dual-graph** (directed + undirected edges over the same node set) — most systems use one graph type
- **AI-native binary format** (.gai) optimized for machine consumption, not human readability
- **Zero-API graph construction** (TF-IDF, no embeddings required) — $0 to build the graph
- **Human audit trail** — giki pages with node citations, contradiction detection, correction API
- **Temporal awareness** — confidence decay, supersedes edges, access tracking per node
- **Identity layer** — automatic person extraction, relationship edges, user profile inference
- **Reflection engine** — automated contradiction detection, cross-domain discovery, transitive edge inference

No single technique here is new. The novelty is the combination into a unified, open-source system.

## Landscape Comparison

graphAI exists alongside other approaches to persistent AI knowledge. Each makes different tradeoffs:

| | **graphAI** | **GBrain** (Garry Tan) | **MemPalace** (Milla Jovovich) | **Karpathy Wiki** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Representation** | Dual-graph (.gai binary) | Markdown files in git | Spatial hierarchy + ChromaDB | Markdown wiki pages |
| **Conversation memory** | Yes (Claude/ChatGPT/Slack) | No | Yes (core feature) | No |
| **Identity tracking** | Auto-extracted person nodes | Manual (people/ dir) | No | Partial (entity pages) |
| **Contradiction detection** | Automated | No | No | LLM lint (manual) |
| **LLM cost to build** | $0 + optional enrichment | ~$5-20/dataset | $0 | ~$10-50/dataset |
| **Human auditability** | Giki pages + audit export | Native (markdown) | Partial | Native (wiki) |
| **Relationships** | Explicit typed edges | Implicit links | Tunnels | Implicit cross-refs |
| **Persistence** | SQLite + .gai files | Git repo | ChromaDB + SQLite | Filesystem |

**Where graphAI wins:** Relationship-aware reasoning, multi-source knowledge fusion, token efficiency, automated contradiction detection.

**Where others win:** GBrain has native git version control. MemPalace has battle-tested conversation recall (96.6% LongMemEval). Karpathy's pattern produces richer narrative synthesis.

**They complement each other:** MemPalace for conversation memory, GBrain for personal knowledge management, graphAI for structured domain knowledge with explicit relationships.

## Why This Matters (vs. Standard RAG)

| Aspect | Standard RAG | graphAI |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Context format | Flat text chunks | Structured subgraph with typed edges |
| Relationships | Implicit (AI must infer) | Explicit (edges with types and weights) |
| Retrieval | Vector similarity on chunks | Graph traversal + synonym expansion + query decomposition |
| Resolution | Fixed chunk size | Hierarchical (zoom in/out via compression levels) |
| Dependencies | Requires embedding API | TF-IDF (pure JS, zero API calls for graph construction) |
| Memory | Stateless per session | Temporal nodes + conversation ingestion + SQLite persistence |
| Corrections | Re-ingest from scratch | In-place edit, supersede, or soft-delete individual nodes |
| Auditability | None | Giki pages, audit reports, contradiction detection |
