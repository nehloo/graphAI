# Graphnosis — Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

Graphnosis is a research prototype that converts raw files into AI-optimized dual-graph knowledge representations. It explores whether structured graphs with typed edges can outperform flat-text RAG for AI comprehension and retrieval.

**Name:** Graphnosis = **graph** + **gnosis** (knowledge) — "graph knowledge" for AI. Formerly "graphAI" (collided with `receptron/graphai` and the GraphAI Inc. trademark) and briefly "Bignosis" before settling here. The `.gai` file extension stands for **Graphnosis AI** — the AI-native knowledge format.

**Origin:** The project began with the question "Are AI models based on non-oriented graphs?" — which evolved into exploring whether knowledge represented as directed + undirected graphs, serialized in a binary format not designed for human readability, could produce better AI outputs than human-readable formats like markdown.

**Prior art:** Microsoft GraphRAG, LightRAG, LazyGraphRAG explore graph-based RAG. Graphnosis's contribution is the specific combination of dual-graph (directed+undirected over same nodes) + AI-native binary format + human audit trail + temporal awareness + identity extraction + reflection engine — which hasn't been published as a unified system.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Dual-graph over same node set.** Every knowledge unit (node) has both directed edges (causal, temporal, hierarchical, identity) and undirected edges (similarity, association). This provides richer reasoning paths than either graph type alone.

2. **AI-native serialization.** The .gai binary format (MessagePack) is optimized for token efficiency, not human readability. The subgraph serialization format (`[nodeId|type|score] content`) is designed for LLM consumption.

3. **Zero-API similarity.** TF-IDF + cosine similarity runs entirely in-process with no external API calls. This makes the pipeline fully local and open-source friendly. Embedding support is optional.

4. **Explicit relationships in prompts.** Instead of flat text chunks, the LLM receives a structured subgraph with typed edges. This enables chain-of-thought reasoning along graph edges rather than forcing the model to infer connections.

5. **Temporal awareness.** Nodes track creation time, access patterns, and confidence scores. Knowledge decays if not reinforced. Superseded information remains in the graph but scores lower. Corrections get maximum confidence.

6. **Identity as first-class.** People mentioned across sources get dedicated person nodes with relationship edges. The system tracks who knows whom, who worked on what, and infers user preferences from conversation patterns.

7. **Human-in-the-loop.** Corrections (add/edit/supersede/soft-delete) feed back into the graph with maximum confidence. Giki pages provide human-readable views with node citations. Audit reports surface contradictions and coverage gaps.

## Security and Robustness Guardrails

### Input Validation
- All file parsers handle malformed input gracefully (empty content, missing sections)
- PDF parser uses heuristic section detection with fallback to single-section mode
- CSV/JSON parsers validate structure before processing
- Conversation parser auto-detects format (Claude/ChatGPT/Slack/raw) with fallback
- Wikipedia/arXiv/NASA fetchers have per-request error handling

### Graph Integrity
- **Content hash deduplication:** Identical content produces identical hashes; duplicates are merged
- **Auto-pruning:** Orphan nodes (zero edges) are removed after graph construction
- **Checksum verification:** .gai files include a 4-byte checksum; corrupted files are rejected
- **Edge weight thresholds:** Similarity >= 0.3, entity Jaccard >= 0.2. Below these, edges aren't created
- **Soft-delete only:** Corrections never hard-delete. Soft-delete sets validUntil + confidence 0.1

### Performance Bounds
- **O(n) similarity via inverted index:** Terms appearing in 500+ documents are skipped
- **Max 10 edges per node:** Prevents hub explosion
- **Max 50 similarity candidates per node:** Caps comparison work
- **Max 20 nodes per query subgraph:** Keeps token budget bounded (~2K tokens avg)
- **3-hop BFS with 0.6 decay:** Score decays exponentially with distance
- **Contradiction detection:** Strict patterns only (reclassified, disputed, disproven) — not loose negation words
- **Rate limiting:** Wikipedia (100ms), arXiv (3s), NASA (2s) between API requests

### Temporal Safety & Forgetting
- Confidence decays ~1%/day after 7 days without access (floor at 0.1)
- Expired nodes (validUntil < now) score 0.3x in queries
- Superseded nodes retain original content for audit trail
- Human corrections always get confidence 1.0
- Bulk forget by time window: soft-deletes all nodes created before a given date
- Bulk forget by topic: soft-deletes all nodes matching an entity or content string
- Cascade soft-delete: follows contains edges and same-source to soft-delete downstream nodes
- Nothing is ever hard-deleted — all forgetting is reversible via the audit trail
- Reflection engine (POST /api/graph/reflect): runs contradiction detection, confidence decay, transitive edge inference, and cross-domain discovery on demand

### Data Safety
- SQLite persistence with WAL mode for concurrent reads
- API keys loaded from environment variables, never hardcoded
- .env files are gitignored; only .env.example is committed
- No user data transmitted beyond the current session
- All dependencies MIT or Apache-2.0 licensed

## Code Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- All graph types defined in `src/core/types.ts` — single source of truth (40+ interfaces)
- Parsers are stateless functions: `(input, sourceFile) -> ParsedDocument`
- Graph operations are pure: `(graph, params) -> { graph, stats }`
- AI SDK v6 patterns: `@ai-sdk/react` for client, manual UIMessage->ModelMessage conversion on server
- Chat context fetch tracks `lastContextMsgId` to prevent re-fetch on streaming tokens
